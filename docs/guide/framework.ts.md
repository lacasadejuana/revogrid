## TypeScript

Define webcomponent `<revo-grid/>` and you can access it property in natural way. Check [Quick start](./) for more information.
Works exactly same way as Vanilla Js, all typings supported from component folder.

`<revo-grid/>` fully based on typescript support. 
It provides transparent type definition with minimal documentation needed for basic understanding of component.
